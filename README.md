- 👋 Hi, I’m @owlthinkabtit
- 👀 I’m interested in an array of things, y'know, "jack of all trades, master of none. but oftentimes better than a master of one." Though if I could narrow it down, I'm most interested in: space/time, technology, art (creating my own comics), crocheting, and cooking!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...how to code, and the languages that are essenstial for me to progress in this feild. Currently I'm learning more about javascript, and I'm proficient in HTML5 and CSS. My goal is to become a frontend developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...nothing at this moment, I have much to learn. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...my socials are linked somewhere on here, lol. 
- 😄 Pronouns: ...she/they 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I wanted to be a neurologist when I was a kid.
